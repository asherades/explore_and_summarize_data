## Data Analyst Nanodegree Project: Explore and Summarize Data

In this project, I used two Tidyverse packages, Ggplot and Dplyr, to manipulate, group, and visualize data in R. The dataset contains 
information on gun deaths from 2012-2014. I explored expected patterns, discovered anomalies, and explained the most interesting plots
at the end of the notebook.

Files in this repository:

* `Gun Deaths EDA Project and Report.Rmd` - R Markdown file containing code to generate plots and explanations of plots. Requires that you
have R installed on your computer as well the Knitr, Tidyverse, and Readr packages installed.
* `Gun Deaths EDA Project and Report.html` - easily viewable version of report with plots and explanations. Recommended if you do not wish
to look at the code.
* `References.rtf` - a list of web sites referred to or used in this project
* `gun_deaths_final explanation.rtf` - a brief description of the dataset and its variables (also can be found in the report)
* `gun_deaths_final.csv` - the dataset used in the R Markdown file
